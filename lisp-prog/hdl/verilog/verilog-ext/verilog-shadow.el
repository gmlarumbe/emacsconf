;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This was an attempt to create buffers without comments for better parsing.
;; Comments are a major problem for regexp-based parsing, in particular in
;; multiline constructs (e.g. a module instance).  It has been workedaround in
;; `verilog-navigation' by using `verilog-re-search-forward', which ignores
;; comments but limits these searchs to one word per regexp.
;;
;; Anyway, this package is left here for the unlikely case this could be of use
;; to someone willing to use it, maybe as a starting point, to add new
;; functionality. However, there seem to be better alternatives, like using a
;; parser based on an external application (e.g. tree-sitter, verilator, slang
;; or verible).
